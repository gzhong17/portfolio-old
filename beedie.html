              <p>This was a solo project where I had to do user research, design layout, and figure out the structure of where the live feeds would be coming from.</p></div>
            <div class="col-1"><p>Originally, SFU Beedie's social media channels were posted separately on their website. In an effort to traffic to the channels and improve convenience for the students, this social media hub was built.</p

            <h2>CHALLENGES &amp; DECISIONS</h2>
            <div class="columns">
            <div class="col-1">
            <p>A major challenge I had with this project was learning new programming languages and tools such as PHP, jQuery, and API. I was unfamiliar with them and had to learn them on the job. Through personal research on these topics and learning from my supervisor, I was able to complete the project.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-1">
            <p>Another obstacle I came across was figuring out how to display all the social media channels on the page while keeping them easily accessible and not hidden. The solution I came up with was to build a tab that can toggle different social media platforms, and then show the appropriate set of accounts for the chosen platform.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-1">
            <p>Through the use of icons, fonts, lines, and colour, these subtle cues help users navigate across the different sections of the page. The grey highlight when hovering or selecting different channels of social media also indicates which accounts are selected as well as visually directing the user towards the list of accounts because of the arrow shape. The icons also help provide recognition and label the source of the posts or photos (eg: Flickr, Twitter).</p>

            <h2>OUTCOME &amp; GROWTH</h2>
            <div class="columns">
            <div class="col-1">
            <p>My growth as a designer and developer has drastically grown since I tackled this project. A lesson I took away from this assignment was to keep trying new solutions out instead of hesitating and become overwhelmed with the unknown.</p></div>
            <div class="col-1"><p>Also, I learned to always consider what content is most important to the user and give appropriate cues to help the user navigate to it.</p>
