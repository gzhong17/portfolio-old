          <div class="columns">
            <div class="col-1">
              <p>The SharePoint Workspaces home page is the main “hub” that introduces SharePoint and the services that Fraser Health provides in regards to SharePoint. The page directs users to fill in request/help forms, sign up for training, directs users to our Workspaces support site, and post of upcoming events.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-1">
              <p>
                The SharePoint Workspaces Support Site houses a library of support articles. Help articles are divided by introduction, user basics, and administrator levels. Fraser Health users can follow through these tutorials of how to use SharePoint.</p>

                  <p>My tasks included analyzing the current design, identify user requirements, research, create mock ups, design icons, and build the final implementation.</p>

              <div class="columns">
                <div class="col-1"><p>Some challenges I met include finding the most suitable way to organize the page, identifying which elements were important (or not), and be graphically creative but look professional for a corporate setting.</p></div>
                <div class="col-1"> 
                  <p>I had realized the big blocky headers were unhelpful and pushed information towards the bottom of the page. A cleaner appearance, and regrouping information into a simple, concise section was decided upon this observation.</p></div>
                  <div class="col-1"><p>
                    The support page needed restructuring as the original page was overwhelming for users due to the endless list of articles on the page. A decision was made to move user basics and administrator topics to separate pages and instead have a simple link on the main support page that points to the two separate pages.</p></div>
                  </div>

                      <p>Being conscious of how information is presented affects users’ experiences with the product or application. Users like efficiency and as designers, it is our job to make their process as smooth and quick as possible.</p></div>
                      <div class="col-1"><p>If we are not careful with choosing what information we share and the way it is shared, users often will be unable to find what they are looking for and become frustrated.</p></div>
