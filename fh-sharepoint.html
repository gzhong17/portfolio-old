            <div class="col-1">
              <p>The SharePoint Workspaces home page is the main “hub” that introduces SharePoint and the services that Fraser Health provides in regards to SharePoint. The page directs users to fill in request/help forms, sign up for training, directs users to our Workspaces support site, and post of upcoming events.</p>

            <div class="col-1">
              <p>
                The SharePoint Workspaces Support Site houses a library of support articles. Help articles are divided by introduction, user basics, and administrator levels. Fraser Health users can follow through these tutorials of how to use SharePoint.</p>

              <h2>CHALLENGES &amp; DECISIONS</h2>

              <div class="columns">
                <div class="col-1"><p>Some challenges I met include finding the most suitable way to organize the page, identifying which elements were important (or not), and be graphically creative but look professional for a corporate setting. I made different variations of icons and colour schemes, which was reviewed and approved by my supervisors.</p></div>
                <div class="col-1"> 
                  <p>I had realized the big blocky headers on the original page were unhelpful and pushed information towards the bottom of the page. A cleaner appearance, and regrouping information into a simple, concise section was decided upon this observation.</p></div>
                  <div class="col-1"><p>
                    The support page needed restructuring as the original page was overwhelming for users due to the endless list of articles on the page. A decision was made to move user basics and administrator topics to separate pages and instead have a simple link on the main support page that points to the two separate pages.</p></div>
                    <div class="col-1"><p>
                      In order to guide users to the appropriate page, I created banners that clearly label sections respective to the level of the user. Furthermore, by providing a short description with the names of most commonly read articles, users can easily familiarize with these structural changes through these cues.</p></div>
                      <div class="col-1"><p>Along with using graphics, colour, fonts, proximity, and other design principles, I made sure users can visually understand the changes made in the new design and easily navigate within.</p></div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>OUTCOME &amp; GROWTH</h2>
